## Development Philosophy

- **Keep it simple**: Don't over-engineer
- **Security first**: Authorize everything
- **Test the important stuff**: Business logic, calculations, authorization
- **Use Rails conventions**: Don't fight the framework
- **Document as you go**: Update this file when patterns change
